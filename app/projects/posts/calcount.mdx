## Description

Being a fitness orientated individual that loves to code, what better beginner project could there be than one at the intersection of health and technology. By building this webscraping tool. I hope to one day be able to implement it in either a website or app that achieves a new goal, adding complexity to the work I am doing.

## Features

* Label Search—allows the user to find the total calories, fat, protein, and carbohydrates for nearly any food item
* Daily Log—a CSV file that users can track their daily food intake with, split by date
* Calorie Calculator—given a target weight, can help you reach your goal based on the Revised Harris-Benedict Equation

## Code Snippets

Instantiating the Web Driver:

```Python
def browserStart():
    print("Macro Tracker V1 Starting...")
    driver=webdriver.Safari();print('Opening nutrition website...')
    driver.get('https://www.myfooddiary.com/')
    return driver
```

Calculating target macros/calories:

```Python
sex=input('Are you male or female? (m/f): ')
    age=int(input('What is your current age?: '))
    weight=float(input('How much do you currently weigh? (in lbs): '))*0.45359237
    height=float(input('What is your height in inches?: '))*2.54
    activity=input('Are you sedentary, lightly, moderately, or very active? (s,l,m,v):  ')
    goal=input('Are you trying to lose, maintain, or gain weight? (l,m,g): ')
    nl()

    try:
        if sex=='m': bmr=10*weight+6.25*height-5*age+5
        elif sex=='f': bmr=10*weight+625*height-5*age-161
        else: raise Exception('Ensure that you select a correct sex value.')

        if activity=='s': mult=1.2
        elif activity=='l': mult=1.375
        elif activity=='m': mult=1.55
        elif activity=='v': mult=1.725
        else: raise Exception('Ensure that you select a correct activity value.')

        if goal=='l': currentGoal=bmr*mult*.8
        elif goal=='m': currentGoal=bmr*mult+500
        elif goal=='g': currentGoal=bmr*mult
        else: raise Exception('Ensure that you select a correct weight goal value.')
    except Exception as e: print(e)

    print(f'Current goal is: \n{currentGoal} calories \n{currentGoal*.4/4}g of carbohydrates\n{currentGoal*.3/4}g of protein\n {currentGoal*.3/9}g of fat')
```

Parsing through HTML data:

```Python
#Lead up to click selected food item for nutrition facts
item=nutritionElements[itemPick-1]
idTag= item.get_attribute("id")
element=driver.find_element(By.ID, idTag)
driver.execute_script("arguments[0].click();", element)
time.sleep(1)

#Nutritional information printed and saved to memory
calories=driver.find_element(By.XPATH, '//*[@id="nf_cal_hldr"]/div').text
fat=driver.find_element(By.CLASS_NAME, "GramsFat").text
carbohydrates=driver.find_element(By.CLASS_NAME, "GramsCarbs").text
protein=driver.find_element(By.CLASS_NAME, "GramsProtein").text
print(f'NUTRITION FACTS:\n{calories=}\n{fat=}\n{carbohydrates=}\n{protein=}')
```
