Beginning in December 2023, I began exploring webscraping, and how I can incorporate it into my next project. The result, Calcount, demonstrates
how I leveraged the **Selenium library** to extract data from <a href="https://myfooddiary.com/">MyFoodDiary</a> to create a nutritional value tracking
program that helps me watch I eat mindfully.

## Features

* Label Search—allows the user to find the total calories, fat, protein, and carbohydrates for nearly any food item

* Daily Log—a CSV file that users can track their daily food intake with, split by date

* Calorie Calculator—given a target weight, can help you reach your goal based on the Revised Harris-Benedict Equation

## Purpose

Being a fitness orientated individual that loves to code, what better beginner project could there be than one at the intersection of health
and technology. By building this webscraping tool. I hope to one day be able to implement it in either a website or app that achieves a new goal,
adding complexity to the work I am doing.
