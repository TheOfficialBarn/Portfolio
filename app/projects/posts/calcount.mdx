## Description

Being a fitness orientated individual that loves to code, what better beginner project could there be than one at the intersection of health and technology. By building this webscraping tool. I hope to one day be able to implement it in either a website or app that achieves a new goal, adding complexity to the work I am doing.

## Features

* Label Search—allows the user to find the total calories, fat, protein, and carbohydrates for nearly any food item

* Daily Log—a CSV file that users can track their daily food intake with, split by date

* Calorie Calculator—given a target weight, can help you reach your goal based on the Revised Harris-Benedict Equation
