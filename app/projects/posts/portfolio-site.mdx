## Description

Wanting to continue where I left off from my first HTML/CSS site, I decided to dive deeper into web technologies React and Next.js. With mobile development experience from earlier this summer, I found picking up on components, packages, and file directory best practices came relatively easily.

With this experience under my belt, I plan to dive into different web full stacks soon!
