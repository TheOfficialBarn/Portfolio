## Description

TuahTone is a WebApp that allows users to select a song from a Spotify provided playlist and view the lyrics. If it a song they would like to learn, they can add it to their library! This adds it to Songs, and adds the lyrics to Words. OpenAI translates each word to their native language upon flipping the flashcard, which prevents unnecessary translations of all words.

The WebApp is designed to be responsive to a variety of different screen-sizes, allowing users to have the optimal experience whether on mobile, tablet, or computer!

We used Firebase as the backend to store user information such as songs saved, words saved, and their native language.
