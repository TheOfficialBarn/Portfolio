## Description

Prepr is an iOS application that generates saveable recipes using OpenAI's Completions API with 3.5*turbo*.
Recipes can then be added to a queue—displayed on a calendar—to make planning meals easier. When a meal is queued, a dynamic grocery list is updated with needed ingredients. Firebase is used to store each user's data along with providing authentication so that each user can have their own profile. To protect any API keys from getting leaked, a .env file is stored on my device.
